# jasmine-test-injector

A script injector for unit testing closure. Allow unit test spec run at the closure context.

This script works for any javascript unit testing framework.

The injector will inject your test spec script into inside the closure. Unlike dependence injection (DI), which injected module itself can not access the caller's scope.
